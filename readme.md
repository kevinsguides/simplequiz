# YAQ (Yet Another Quiz Extension)

# PROJECT DISCONTINUED 9/19/24
I no longer have time to support this and frankly it's too large of a project to be worth the $100 I've made off it. Ya cheap batards lol.
I'll leave it up if anyone wants to pick it up.

This is a component for Joomla 4/5.

It allows you to add graded review quizzes to your website.

Currently, this is in beta. Do not use on critical sites or without testing.
## Requirements
You just need a site running Joomla 5 with a template that uses Bootstrap 5 (most templates will work).

Install it like any other component. Extension works with Joomla's cache system, but not the full page cache plugin.


## What's Working...
* Create Quizzes and Questions
* Multiple Choice Questions
* True/False Questions
* Fill in blank / input text Questions
* Question Points System
* Basic Question Feedback System
* Basic form validation
* Quiz access levels on front end
* Some, but not all permissions are respected
* Question ordering
* Single page or multi page quizzes
* Basic access control (for create edit delete)
* record hit and submission count of each quiz
* checkins for quizzes are working
* javascript quiz mode
* cache first page of quizzes (or entire quiz for js quizzes)
* Able to save general and individual quiz results for every user
* Display general stats about a quiz, like # of subs and average score
* Import questions from Excel spreadsheet 
* Basic templating system for all front end pages
* You can set a limit on the number of quiz attempts for logged in users.
* Permission for viewing other users results
* Page to view users results in backend
* reset stats, attempt count, etc.
* two main styles + custom
* Quiz Certificates (PDF)
* Router with SEF URLs, Quiz item alias, etc.

## Todo
* parent front end all quizzes view
* HTML quiz cert option for performance or compatibility
* expire/auto remove results after x days
* maybe show all quizzes the user has taken on first page, then their results for each quiz on a separate page, rather than all results for all quiz on one page
* make checkin system work for quizzes and questions
* quiz by category - a quiz that automatically pulls all questions from a category
* randomize from pool - ability to select a random # of questions from a category
* Other question types
    * hot spot
    * matching
    * dropdown or dragging fill in blank
* Fix Language Files/Constants (~90 done)
* Individually edit student grades, delete individual records, etc.
* Score/range based quizzes (Personality tests, diagnostic tests, range etc.)
* Email results to teacher and/or student (or just use kind of like a general form builder)
* Auto category mode - Each quiz is given a unique category and questions are automatically isolated to that quiz
* Easy insert mode - add quiz questions with JS, more responsive
* Overhaul JS quiz system to tie in with rest of the system
