# Simple Quiz
[KevinsGuides.com](https://kevinsguides.com)

Component to be renamed because I found out another "Simple Quiz" extension exists already for Joomla 4... oops.

This is a component for Joomla 4.

It allows you to add quizzes to your website.

Currently, this is in pre-production. Would not recommend use on production sites.

**Newer versions may not be backwards compatible with older test versions.**

## What's Working...

* Multiple Choice Questions
* True/False Questions
* Fill in blank / input text Questions
* Question Points System
* Basic Question Feedback System

## Todo
